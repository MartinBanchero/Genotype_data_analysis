# mpxtractor
**mpxtractor: A flexible R package to process data from different plate reader machines.**

<div align="justify">

The main function of mpxtractor is to provide a simple method that can
process raw data from microplate readers like SpectraMax, FluorStar, and
MultiscanGO and apply different methods to it. This package generates
tidy tibble objects, this data can be combined with layout files, and then
growth rates are calculated and plot over a microplate frame. This is a
critical point in several research lines performing experiments using
microplate reader machines mainly due to the time that takes to clean
and sort the raw data into a tidy format. Also, the features of this
package allow detecting which wells present faulty data e.g wells not
filled correctly. Another feature of mpxtractor is that it allows
plotting the layout file over a microplate frame, this is very useful.

2. Check MAF (SNP-level)
========================================================================
Minor allele frequency (MAF). A large degree of homogeneity at a given SNP
across study participants generally results in inadequate power to infer a statistically significant
relationship between the SNP and the trait under study. This can occur when we have a very small
MAF so that the large majority of individuals have two copies of the major allele.

.. note::

   Threshold for MAF can vary between 1% and 5% (for small sample settings)

.. note::
	**Advice** For small sample size it is recommended to exclude SNPs with MAF \< 0.05.

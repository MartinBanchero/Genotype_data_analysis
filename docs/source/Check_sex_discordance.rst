4. Check sex discordance (Sample-level)
========================================================================
Sample mix-up is investigated by looking at sex mismatch, where sex
information of each sample is compared with genotypes at chromosomes X and Y.

.. note:: 
	**NB:** This method however does not detect same sex sample mix-ups and is not reliable when there are sex chromosome abnormalities.
	??For this step we need to use files with already excluded low call rate SNPs
